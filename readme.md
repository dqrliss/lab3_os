/Applications/Parallels Desktop.app/Contents/Frameworks/QtXml.framework/Versions/5/QtXml The target file already exists. Should I rewrite it? [y/n]  y
This is a FAT format binary carrying code for 2 architectures (Intel/Apple Silicon ARM64).
Found code load signature: LC_CODE_SIGNATURE load command. Should I delete it automatically? [y/n] y
LC_CODE_SIGNATURE is not the last load command, so couldn't remove.
Add the LC_LOAD_DYLIB instruction to the generic architecture, application:/Applications/Parallels Desktop.app/Contents/Frameworks/QtXml.framework/Versions/5/QtXmlã€‚
[*] Make sure that your version is: https://download.parallels.com/desktop/v18/18.3.1-53614/ParallelsDesktop-18.3.1-53614.dmg
[*] Copying forged authorisation documents licenses.json
[*] Cracking completed 

if Parallels hangs then
quit Parallels
run in terminal
/Applications/Parallels\ Desktop.app/Contents/MacOS/Parallels\ Service service_stop  &>/dev/null
now all problems are gone
maybe you will have click 2 times to start the VM ( but only once)
